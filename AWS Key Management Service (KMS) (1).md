# **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**

## **Introduction**

AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is a managed service that allows you to create, manage, and use cryptographic keys to encrypt and decrypt data. It helps secure your data and meet compliance requirements in a user-friendly way.

## **Key Features of KMS**

1. **Centralized Key Management**:
   - Create and manage cryptographic keys from a single interface.

2. **Data Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data using symmetric or asymmetric encryption.

3. **Integration with AWS Services**:
   - Works seamlessly with services like S3, RDS, EBS, DynamoDB, Lambda, and others.

4. **Secure Key Usage**:
   - Use KMS keys for signing and verifying data, API requests, or securing applications.

5. **Key Rotation**:
   - Enable automatic annual rotation of keys for improved security.

6. **Multi-Region Keys**:
   - Replicate keys across AWS regions for high availability and disaster recovery.

7. **Compliance**:
   - KMS is FIPS 140-2 compliant, helping organizations meet regulatory requirements.

## **Types of KMS Keys**

1. **Symmetric Keys**:
   - Use the same key for encryption and decryption.
   - Commonly used for general encryption.

2. **Asymmetric Keys**:
   - Use a public-private key pair.
   - Ideal for digital signatures and secure communications.

## **Real-Life Applications of KMS**

1. Encrypting Sensitive Data
2. Data Sharing
3. Secure Backups
4. IoT Device Data
5. Regulatory Compliance

## **Step-by-Step Examples**

### **1. Creating a Key**

Use the AWS Management Console to create a KMS key:
1. Navigate to the **KMS Console**.
2. Click **Create Key**.
3. Choose the type (Symmetric or Asymmetric) and provide a name (e.g., `MyKey`).
4. Configure key policies to grant access to specific users or services.
5. Click **Create Key**.

## AWS-Managed Keys vs. Customer-Managed Keys

**AWS KMS provides two primary types of keys: AWS-managed keys and customer-managed keys. The choice depends on the level of control, flexibility, and compliance requirements of your use case.**

## AWS-Managed Keys

- Control: Fully managed by AWS. AWS handles key creation, rotation (every year), and deletion.

- Use Case: Ideal for quick setup with minimal customization.

- Examples:

    - Default encryption for Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, DynamoDB, etc.

- Limitations:

    - Limited control over key policies.

    - Cannot specify custom rotation schedules.

## Customer-Managed Keys (CMKs)

- Control: Full control over the key, including creation, key policies, rotation, and deletion.

- Use Case:

    - full permissions.

    - Custom rotation schedule access.

    - Compliance with regulations requiring specific key management practices.

- Examples:

    - Encrypting sensitive data in custom applications.

    - Cross-account or cross-region encryption setups.
